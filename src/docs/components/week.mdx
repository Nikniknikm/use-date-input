# Week
The `Week` components renders a week, as a row of `Day` components based on the current `Calendar` state.

## Example
<Playground>
{() => {
    const { addDays, createDate } = dateAdapter();
    const today = createDate();
    const days = Array(7).fill(0).reduce((result, day, dayIndex) => {
       return [ ...result, addDays(today, dayIndex)];
    }, []);
    return (
        <CalendarProvider adapter={dateAdapter}>
            <Week days={days} parentMonth={today} />
        </CalendarProvider>
    );
}}
</Playground>

## Props 
| Prop Name | Type | Is Required | Default Value | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| className| `string`| optional| | Class name of root element |
| days| `array`| required| | Array of dates to render |
| parentMonth| `object`| required| | to determine days of weeks, which are outside of current month |

## Importing
It can be imported as either the base component

```javascript
import { Week } from "@use-date-input/core";
```

or as an overridable component that can be replaced through the `components` prop in `CalendarProvider`.  
Refer to [How to replace UI components](https://mark-tate.github.io/use-date-input/theming#how-to-replace-ui-components).

```javascript
import { Week } from "@use-date-input/core";
```

If providing your own component, it can be useful to import the base component and use it within your composition.

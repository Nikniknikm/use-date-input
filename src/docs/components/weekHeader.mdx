# WeekHeader
The `WeekHeader` component renders the days of the week within the month header.

## Example
<Playground>
{() => {
    return (
        <CalendarProvider adapter={dateAdapter}>
            <WeekHeader/>
        </CalendarProvider>
    );
}}
</Playground>

## Props 
| Prop Name | Type | Is Required | Default Value | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| className| `string`| optional| | Class name of root element |

## Importing
It can be imported as either the base component

```javascript
import { WeekHeader } from "@use-date-input/core";
```

or as an overridable component that can be replaced through the `components` prop in `CalendarProvider`.  
Refer to [How to replace UI components](https://mark-tate.github.io/use-date-input/theming#how-to-replace-ui-components).

```javascript
import { WeekHeader } from "@use-date-input/core";
```

If providing your own component, it can be useful to import the base component and use it within your composition.

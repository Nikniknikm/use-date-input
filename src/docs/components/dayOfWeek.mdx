# DayOfWeek
The `DayOfWeek` components renders a day of the week.

In the default implementation, [WeekHeader](https://mark-tate.github.io/use-date-input/weekHeader) is the parent of `DayOfWeek`.

## Example
<Playground>
    <DayOfWeek description={'Monday'}>M</DayOfWeek>
</Playground>

## Props 
| Prop Name | Type | Is Required | Default Value | Description |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| children| `node`| optional| | Day of week node|
| className| `string`| optional| | Class name of root element|
| description| `string`| optional| | Day of week expanded label|

## Importing
It can be imported as either the base component

```javascript
import { DayOfWeek } from "@use-date-input/core";
```

or as an overridable component that can be replaced through the `components` prop in `CalendarProvider`.  
Refer to [How to replace UI components](https://mark-tate.github.io/use-date-input/theming#how-to-replace-ui-components).

```javascript
import { CustomisableDayOfWeek } from "@use-date-input/core";
```

If providing your own component, it can be useful to import the base component and use it within your composition.

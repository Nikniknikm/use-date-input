# State

`use-date-input` comes with a set of default reducers which are composed together to create
the state for `useDateInput`, `useDateRangeInput` and `Calender`.

You can override the default state or add additional state, whatever your components need, with the `reducers` prop.  
The `reducers` prop can be provided to either `CalendarProvider` or `Calendar`.

In this example we change the selection created by the default reducers, so that it adds 1 week to any date that is selected.  
Any part of the default state can be modified in this way.

<Playground>
{() => {
    // import { Calendar, calendarReducer, calendarActions, singleDateReducer } from "@use-date-input/core";
    // import dateAdapter from "@use-date-input/date-fns-adapter";
    function handleStateChange(newState, changes) {
        console.log('new state', newState.startDate, changes);
    }
    const myReducer = (state, action, dateAPI) => {
       if (action.type === calendarActions.selectDate) {
          return {...state, startDate: dateAPI.addWeeks(state.startDate, 1) }
       }
       return state;
    };
    return (
        <Calendar 
            adapter={dateAdapter} 
            reducers={[ calendarReducer, singleDateReducer, myReducer]}
            onStateChange={handleStateChange}
        />
    );
}}
</Playground>

## Default Reducers  

A brief description of the default reducers.


### calendarReducer  
```javascript
import { calendarReducer, calendarActions } from "@use-date-input/core";
```

Creates the state for a stand-alone `Calendar` with no associated input.  
 
Associated actions :  

- focusDate - Focus a specific date
- keyPress - Keyboard action
- mouseClickOutside - Mouse clicked outside of Calendar (or allow list)
- navigatePrevious - Navigate to the previous month
- navigateNext - Navigate to the next month
- selectDate - Select a date (emulating keyboard or mouse selection)
- setAnimating - Create the transient state of animating between dates (used to prevent interim selection)
- setEnableKeyboardNavigation - Enable the navigation of the `Calendar` cursor with the keyboard controls
- setEndDate - Create an end date for a date range (programatically)
- setFocusableDate - Enable/Disable focusable dates within the `Calendar` 
- setKeyboardCursor - Set the keyboard cursor within the `Calendar` 
- setMouseCursor - Set the mouse cursor within the `Calendar` 
- setStartDate - Create an start date for a date range (programatically)
- setOpen - Open the visible state of the `Calendar`
- setVisibleFromDate - Set the initial visible month

### singleDateReducer
```javascript
import { singleDateReducer, calendarActions } from "@use-date-input/core";
```

When combined with the `singleDateReducer` it selects single dates.  

Associated actions :  

- Uses the `calendarReducer` actions

### dateRangeReducer
```javascript
import { dateRangeReducer, calendarActions } from "@use-date-input/core";
```

When combined with the `calendarReducer` it selects a date range.   

Associated actions :  

- Uses the `calendarReducer` actions

### dateInputReducer  
```javascript
import { dateInputReducer, dateInputActions } from "@use-date-input/core";
```

Combines with `calendarReducer` to select a single date from either the `Calendar` or an input.

Associated actions :  

- blurInput : Blur the associated input's focus
- focusInput : Focus the associated input
- focusLock : Enable/Disable the focus lock, so that tabbing behaviour links both input and `Calendar`

### dateRangeInputReducer

```javascript
import { dateRangeInputReducer, dateRangeInputActions, dateRangeInputType } from "@use-date-input/core";
```

Combines with `calendarReducer` to select a date range from either the `Calendar` or 2 inputs, representing the start and end date.  

Associated actions :  

- blurStartDate : Blur the associated input's focus
- blurEndDate : Blur the associated input's focus
- focusStartDate : Focus the associated input
- focusEndDate : Focus the associated input
- focusLock : Enable/Disable the focus lock, so that tabbing behaviour links both input and `Calendar`

## Reading State

Providing an `onStateChange` callback to the `CalendarProvider` enables you to respond to state change.
 
In this example, `state` and `changes` are logged to the console.

<Playground>
{() => {
    // import { Calendar } from "@use-date-input/core";
    // import dateAdapter from "@use-date-input/date-fns-adapter";
    function handleStateChange(newState, changes) {
        console.log('new state', newState, changes);
    }
    return (
        <Calendar adapter={dateAdapter} onStateChange={handleStateChange}/>
    );
}}
</Playground>

## Changing State

In addition to the reducers, state can be modified via the `useCalendarDispatch` hook or an `actions` ref.

###  useCalendarDispatch

Actions can be dispatched via an API returned by the `useCalendarDispatch` hook.  

`useCalendarDispatch` can be used in any child of `CalendarProvider`.  


```javascript
const {
    dispatch,
    mouseClickOutside,
    navigateNext,
    navigatePrevious,
    selectDate,
    setAnimating,
    setEnableKeyboardNavigation,
    setKeyboardCursor,
    setMouseCursor,
    setEndDate,
    setStartDate,
    setOpen,
    setKeyPress,
    setVisibleFromDate
} = useCalendarDispatch();
```

Use `dispatch` or use the helper functions, which wrap the dispatch method, they are equivalent.  

Refer to the [useCalendarDispatch](https://mark-tate.github.io/use-date-input/useCalendarDispatch) docs for examples.

### Actions Ref

Providing an `actions` ref to the `CalendarProvider` enables you to control the Component state externally using either the helper functions or the dispatcher itself.

The ref will be assigned the `useCalendarDispatch` API that enables you to modify the state.

An `actions` ref can be used anywhere, even outside the `CalendarProvider` hierachy and unlike the hook `useCalendarDispatch` can be called, as and when needed.  

In this example, the date range is created by setting the endDate, upon selection of the start date. 
 
<Playground>
{() => {
    // import { useRef, useState } from "react";
    // import { Calendar, CalendarProvider } from "@use-date-input/core";
    // imprt dateAdapter from "@use-date-input/date-fns-adapter";
    const [ storeDate, setStoreDate ] = useState();
    const actions = useRef();
    function handleCalendarChange(value) {
        const [rangeStart, rangeEnd] = value;
        const { setStartDate, setEndDate, dateAPI } = actions.current;
        if (!dateAPI.isSameDay(storeDate, rangeStart)) {
            const endDate = dateAPI.addWeeks(rangeStart, 1);
            setEndDate(endDate);
            setStoreDate(rangeStart);
        }
    }
    return (
        <CalendarProvider
            actions={actions}
            adapter={dateAdapter}
            allowRange
            onCalendarChange={handleCalendarChange}
        >
            <Calendar />
        </CalendarProvider>
    );
}}
</Playground>
